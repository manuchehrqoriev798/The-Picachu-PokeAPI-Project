# The-Picachu-PokeAPI-Project
Designed and implemented a functional Pokedex application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive user interface mimics the appearance of a Pokedex device, allowing users to browse through a list of Pokemon, view details for each Pokemon, and fetch data from the PokeAPI, including names, types, weights, heights, and images.
